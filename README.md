# Untargeted Proteomic Profiling Identifies Novel Candidate Biomarkers for Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality
### Source Code written by Aleksandra Chybowska



#### Key Question
Can mass spectrometry-based serum proteomic profiling improve early detection of CVD and death?
#### Key Finding
Forty-eight highly abundant serum proteins were significantly associated with CVD outcomes and death over 17 years of follow up. This included 24 previously unreported biomarkers linked to immune response, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and the complement cascade.
#### Take-home Message
Untargeted serum proteomics using mass spectrometry reveals novel and known protein biomarkers that improve our understanding of CVD pathophysiology and mortality risk, offering potential for early detection and preventive strategies in the general population.
